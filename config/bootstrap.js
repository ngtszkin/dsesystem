In 2013, the Faculty concluded an agreement with The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, The University of Edinburgh to launch a one-year attachment programme which enables BBiomedSc students to take the Year 1 courses of the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery (BVM&S) degree at The University of Edinburgh on an elective mode, and to articulate into the BVM&S degree of The University of Edinburgh upon completion of BBiomedSc at HKU.  Graduates will be conferred two degrees awarded by the two universities respectively with a total duration of seven years of studies. In 2016 and 2017 respectively, the Faculty concluded an arrangement with The Faculty of Health Science, The University of Sydney (USYD) to launch two further study abroad programmes which enable HKU BBiomedSc students to articulate into USYD's Master of Physiotherapy (MPhty) and Master of Diagnostic Radiography(MDR).  Graduates will be conferred the bachelor's and the master's degrees awarded by the two universities respectively with a total duration of five and a half years of studies. Agreement was also concluded in 2017 with the School of Public Health, The University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) for HKU BBiomedSc students to articulate into UC Berkeley's Master of Public Health (MPH) programme.  A bachelor's and a master's degree by HKU and UC Berkeley will be awarded with a total duration of five years and three months of studies. A highly selected group of BBiomedSc students may be allowed to take the Year 1 courses of the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree programme of HKU on an elective mode during Year 3, and to articulate into the MBBS programme upon completion of the BBiomedSc degree.
